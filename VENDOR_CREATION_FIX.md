# Vendor Creation Issue Fix

## Problem Identified

The vendor creation was failing with an "Unauthorized" error because the frontend was not sending the authentication token with the API requests.

## Root Cause

The vendor API endpoints require authentication, but the frontend requests were not including the JWT token in the Authorization header.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Token Inclusion

- Added token retrieval from localStorage (`auth-token` key)
- Included Authorization header with Bearer token in all vendor-related API requests
- Applied to all CRUD operations:
  - Vendor creation (POST)
  - Vendor updates (PUT)
  - Vendor deletion (DELETE)
  - Vendor product management
  - Vendor status changes

### 2. Updated API Calls

Modified the following files to include authentication headers:

1. **Vendors Page** (`/src/app/vendors/page.tsx`)

   - Vendor creation form submission
   - Vendor deletion
   - Vendor approval toggling

2. **Vendor Detail Page** (`/src/app/vendors/[id]/page.tsx`)

   - Vendor approval status toggling
   - Vendor active status toggling

3. **Vendor Products Page** (`/src/app/vendors/[id]/products/page.tsx`)
   - Adding products to vendors
   - Removing products from vendors

### 3. Implementation Pattern

```typescript
// Get token from localStorage
const token = localStorage.getItem("auth-token");

// Include in fetch request headers
const response = await fetch(url, {
  method: "POST", // or PUT, DELETE
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    ...(token && { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }),
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(data),
});
```

## Testing

The fix has been tested and verified:

- ✅ Vendor creation now works with proper authentication
- ✅ All vendor CRUD operations function correctly
- ✅ Token is properly included in all requests
- ✅ Error handling remains intact
- ✅ Toast notifications work for success and error cases

## Benefits

1. **Fixed Authentication**: Vendor creation and management now work correctly
2. **Consistent Security**: All vendor API calls now properly authenticate
3. **Better User Experience**: Clear success/error feedback with toast notifications
4. **Maintained Functionality**: All existing features continue to work as expected

## Security Considerations

- Token is only included when present in localStorage
- No token exposure in client-side code
- Follows existing authentication patterns in the application
- Maintains role-based access control on the backend

The vendor creation issue has been successfully resolved, and all vendor management features now work correctly with proper authentication.
